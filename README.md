# lazy-predator

A framework for Genetic Programming written in Clojure. GP performs evolutionary optimization of programs. Lazy Predator is based on negative selection and genetic drift.

The design of the system is intended to permit the fitness of an evolutionary individual to be based purely on its own properties in isolation, or on relative rankings between small collections of individuals. Like other evolutionary approaches, optimization is performed without explicit reference to a fitness gradient (it is an derivative-free optimization method). Unlike some evolutionary optimization, a global numeric fitness metric is not required, only the ability to compare the relative fitness of individuals.
